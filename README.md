##Documentation##
The current docs are maintained on github [here](https://github.com/immauss/openvas/tree/master/docs)

### 18 Feb 2021 ###
## A few minor updates and one **BIG** change##
- The restore logs now go to /usr/local/var/log/db-restore.log instead of the terminal
- The start.sh is modifying the feed sync scripts (greenbone-nvt-sync and greenbone-feed-sync) to make the normal output a little quieter.
- And the **BIG** announcement:
# Automated weekly builds with content updates!! #
Early every Monday morning, the image will be rebuilt with the latest feed updates. This means that the latest image will always have  feed data less than 1 week old!!!

I have added some additional functionality to the image:
- Container now does a proper shutdown of postgresql on container stop. (I believe not having this has been the cause of some DB corruption seen in the past.)
- New "RESTORE" option added to restore from a DB backup. [See the Docs](https://github.com/immauss/openvas/tree/master/docs#database-backup)
- Updated  [documentation](https://github.com/immauss/openvas/tree/master/docs)
- New latest tag is now 20.08.04.4.
- There is also a 'beta' tag now. Use this at your own peril as it may or may not work. (probably it will not.)

# Short update
After pushing 20.08.04.1, I realized I had not merged the base db changes. So 20.08.04.2 includes the changes to support the base DB and contains a DB from today.

# Greenbone release 20.08.1 about a week ago. 
### I found out yesterday, and today ... I'm releasing tag: 20.08.04.1. 
- This has the fix in gvmd to make the processing of the feeds more resilient. If you are getting a ton of errors for an NVT that is not in the family, this image will fix it. The problem is actually in the feed,  but the latest gvmd does not get stuck on feed issues. 

- There is also a new beta tag, but as you might expect, this is not really working as it is pulling from the master branch of all the tools. The backend seems to work, but the gsa is just not getting it. This is mainly to help me be ready for the next version by keeping me alert on any new dependencies that may come with the next version. Use it at your own peril.

# Big News !

The latest image, tag 20.08.04 includes a baseline database and feed sync. No more waiting for the feeds to sync and then waiting for gvmd to build the database. This means you can login and start running scans about a minute after running the container!

The downside is the USER and PASSWORD environment variables no longer work as they default (admin:admin) is part of the baseline database. I think I can work around this, but that will have to wait for 20.08.05.

There is also a new environment variable: SKIPSYNC . This does exactly what it says, it bypasses the feed sync on container start to speed you along.

# 20.08 
# NOTE: DO NOT USE THIS WITH YOUR OLD PRE-20.08 database. 

## New with the 20.08 images. ##
- Added an environment var for quietening the feed syncs.
  - QUIET="true" will send the output of the sync scripts on startup to /dev/null
- Added an environment var for increasing redis DBs. 
  - REDISDBS="<number of DBs>"   default is 512.
- This is only what I've added. There are tons of other changes with 20.08 itself.
- New multistage build makes for a MUCH smaller image. Down by more than 1 Gig. Same functionality!
